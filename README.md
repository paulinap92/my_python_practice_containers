# Write a function that takes a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements:
# a string and a list of integers.
# The function should return a dictionary where the key is the upper string (the first element of the tuple),
# and the value is a list containing the sum of the numbers
# and the maximum value in the list (the second element of the tuple).
